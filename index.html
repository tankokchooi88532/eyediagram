  <p class="figure-text">Image 1 reveals several signal integrity issues, including inter-symbol interference (ISI) from overlapping traces, jitter from horizontal spreading, and amplitude noise from vertical fluctuations. These impairments can degrade data reliability and performance. To improve signal quality, it's recommended to apply equalization techniques like FFE and DFE, enhance clock recovery to reduce jitter, use low-loss materials and optimized PCB layouts to minimize channel degradation, and implement signal conditioning methods such as pre-emphasis or de-emphasis. Additionally, maintaining clean power delivery with proper decoupling can help reduce amplitude noise and stabilize the signal.
Image 2 The eye diagram showing overlapping blue waveform traces that form the characteristic multi-level "eye" shapes. The eye openings are partially closed, indicating the presence of timing jitter, inter-symbol interference (ISI), and voltage noise. These impairments reduce the clarity of the signal transitions and can lead to higher bit error rates. To improve signal integrity, it's recommended to apply equalization techniques, optimize transmitter settings, and refine PCB layout to reduce reflections and crosstalk. Additionally, ensuring clean power delivery and minimizing ground bounce will help stabilize the signal levels.
Image 3 show partially closed eye openings, indicating signal degradation primarily due to inter-symbol interference (ISI) and jitter. ISI causes overlapping between symbols, while jitter leads to horizontal spreading of signal transitions, both of which reduce the clarity of the eye openings. To enhance signal integrity, it's recommended to optimize equalization settings to counteract ISI, implement robust clock recovery techniques to minimize jitter, and ensure proper termination and impedance matching in the transmission path to reduce reflections and crosstalk.
Image 4 The eye openings are symmetrical but exhibit noticeable overlap and reduced vertical eye height, suggesting amplitude noise and crosstalk, in addition to previously observed inter-symbol interference (ISI) and jitter. These impairments can degrade signal clarity and increase bit error rates. To improve signal quality, it's recommended to apply advanced equalization techniques (e.g., CTLE, DFE), enhance shielding and PCB layout to reduce crosstalk, and fine-tune transmitter settings such as pre-emphasis and swing levels. Ensuring clean power delivery and minimizing ground bounce can also help stabilize amplitude levels.
Image 5 The signal quality is affected by inter-symbol interference (ISI), timing jitter, amplitude noise, and crosstalk, resulting in partially closed eye openings and reduced vertical eye height.

To improve signal integrity, it's recommended to apply advanced equalization techniques (e.g., CTLE, DFE), optimize transmitter settings (pre-emphasis, swing levels), enhance clock recovery, and refine PCB layout to minimize reflections and coupling. Additionally, ensuring clean power delivery, proper termination, and impedance matching will help stabilize the signal and open the eyes for better performance.

Image 8 While it features symmetrical, interwoven curves in yellow and orange, it lacks the distinct horizontal and vertical axes, eye openings, and transition density typically used to assess signal integrity in high-speed digital communication. Therefore, itâ€™s not suitable for analyzing noise types or making signal improvement recommendations in the context of PCIe Gen 6 PAM4.

Image 9 The eye openings are not fully clear, suggesting the presence of timing jitter, amplitude noise, and possibly crosstalk. The red and yellow regions highlight areas of frequent signal transitions, which may be contributing to eye closure. To improve signal integrity, it's advisable to enhance equalization, reduce jitter through better clock recovery, and optimize PCB layout to minimize coupling and reflections. Additionally, signal conditioning techniques like pre-emphasis and de-emphasis can help restore eye clarity.
